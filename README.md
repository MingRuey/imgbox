imgbox

utilities for image analyzing

After [mlbox](https://github.com/MingRuey/imgbox), this is the 2nd toolset for enhancing develope in CV domain.

Recently I found [fastai-v2](https://github.com/fastai/fastai) and it's nbdev working style interesting.
imgbox and mlbox are created for similar purposes,
with API and its usage feels more naturally for me, and suits better for my current research work.
